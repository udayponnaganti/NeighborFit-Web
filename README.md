## Problem Statement

Finding the right neighborhood is one of the most important decisions people make, yet the process is often overwhelming and based on incomplete information. People struggle with:

- **Information Overload**: Too many websites, reviews, and data points make it difficult to make informed decisions
- **Subjective Reviews**: Online reviews don't account for personal preferences and lifestyle needs
- **Hidden Costs**: Rent is just one factor - commute costs, amenities, and lifestyle expenses add up
- **Lack of Personalization**: Generic recommendations don't consider individual priorities and constraints
- **Security Concerns**: Lack of secure, personalized account management for saving preferences and search history
